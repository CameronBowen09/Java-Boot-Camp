The XML declaration
Every XML file should begin with an XML declaration that identifies the version of
XML being used. For most XML documents, the declaration should look like this:
<?xml version='1.0'?>
Note that the XML declaration does not require an end tag. The XML declaration
should be the first line in the file.
