Defining XML
Most computer-industry pundits agree that XML will completely change the way
you work with computers. Here are just some of the ways XML will revolutionize
the world of computers:
»»Unlock the vast warehouses of data that are locked up in the vaults of
corporate mainframe computers
»»Enable every electronic device on the planet, from the most complex
supercomputers
to desktop computers to cellphones to wristwatches, to
communicate with one another
»»Allow every computer program ever written to exchange data with every
other computer program ever written
»»Probably cure cancer and solve the budget deficit, too
So what is XML, really? Simply put, XML is a way to store and exchange information
in a standardized way that’s easy to create, retrieve, and transfer between
different types of computer systems or programs.
When XML is stored in a file, the file is usually given the extension .xml.
